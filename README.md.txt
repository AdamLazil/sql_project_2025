## Description


In the analytical department of your independent organization, which focuses on the standard of living of citizens, you have agreed to try to answer a few defined research questions addressing the **availability of basic foodstuffs to the general public**. Your colleagues have already identified the key questions they will attempt to answer and will provide this information to the press department. This department will present the results at an upcoming conference focused on this area.

They need **you to prepare robust data materials** that will allow for a **comparison of food availability based on average incomes over a specific time period**.

As supplementary material, also prepare a **table with GDP, the GINI coefficient**, and the population of other European countries for the same period, to serve as a primary comparison for the Czech Republic.


## Research questions

1. Do wages increase across all sectors over the years, or do they decline in some?

2. How many liters of milk and kilograms of bread can be bought for the average wage in the first and last comparable period based on the available price and wage data?

3. Which category of food is becoming more expensive at the slowest rate (i.e., has the lowest percentage year-over-year increase)?

4. Is there a year in which the year-over-year increase in food prices was significantly higher than the increase in wages (by more than 10%)?

5. Does the level of GDP influence changes in wages and food prices? In other words, if GDP grows significantly in a given year, does this result in a noticeably stronger increase in food prices or wages in the same or following year?
