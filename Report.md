# The price of the analyzed food items does not grow faster than the average wage

From the available data, we found that in 2006, it was possible to purchase 1,283 kg of bread from the average wage of 20,677 CZK, at an average price of 16.12 CZK per loaf.
At the end of the observed period, in 2018, when the average wage had increased by 57% to 32,485 CZK, it was possible to purchase 1,340 kg of bread, which is 4.4% more.
We can thus observe a slight increase, but for a more accurate assessment, we would need to account for inflation and its impact on food prices.
For the second monitored food item, milk, it was possible in 2006 to purchase 1,432 liters at a price of 14.44 CZK per liter.
In 2018, the number of liters increased by 14.4% to 1,639 liters, at a price of 19.82 CZK.
We can therefore see that the price of bread in relation to the average wage increased more than that of milk.
