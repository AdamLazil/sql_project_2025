# The wages in analyzed period of time is growing

However, this growth is not constant, and in some years, all sectors experience a decline in average wages. The most affected period of decline was between 2009 and 2013.
The most significant wage decrease was recorded in the **Financial and Insurance Services** sector in 2013, when the average wage dropped year-over-year by 8.91%.
Nevertheless, despite this substantial decline, the Financial and Insurance Services sector remains among the sectors with the highest average wages.

The results of the analysis show that the average wage **increased across all observed sectors** between 2006 and 2018.
The **Health and Social Care sector** experienced the highest percentage growth in average wage, with the final value at the end of the period being nearly 80% higher than in the first year.
Other sectors with a significant increase in average wage of over 70% include **Cultural, Entertainment, and Recreational Activities** and the **Manufacturing Industry**.
In the remaining sectors, average wage growth ranged between 40% and 60%.


# The price of the analyzed food items does not grow faster than the average wage

From the available data, we found that in 2006, it was possible to purchase 1,283 kg of bread from the average wage of 20,677 CZK, at an average price of 16.12 CZK per loaf.
At the end of the observed period, in 2018, when the average wage had increased by 57% to 32,485 CZK, it was possible to purchase 1,340 kg of bread, which is 4.4% more.
We can thus observe a slight increase, but for a more accurate assessment, we would need to account for inflation and its impact on food prices.
For the second monitored food item, milk, it was possible in 2006 to purchase 1,432 liters at a price of 14.44 CZK per liter.
In 2018, the number of liters increased by 14.4% to 1,639 liters, at a price of 19.82 CZK.
We can therefore see that the price of bread in relation to the average wage increased more than that of milk.


# The smallest year-over-year increase in food prices

The best result, meaning the smallest increase in average price compared to the previous year, was recorded for **plant-based spreadable fat**, where the average price barely changed and in 2009 was only **0.01%** higher.
One of the largest year-over-year price increases was seen in **bell peppers**, where the price in 2007 was **94.82%** higher than the previous year.
Throughout the years, some food items across all categories also experienced price decreases, meaning that certain goods became cheaper.


# The food prices against wages

During the analyzed period, there was no year in which food prices increased by more than 10% compared to the growth in average wages.
The largest difference between the increase in food prices and average wage growth occurred in 2012 in the construction sector, where the year-over-year wage increase was only 0.33%, while food prices rose by 6.94%.

# GDP correlation

|0.49|GDP/Payroll|


The results of the correlation analysis show that there is a moderate positive relationship between GDP growth and the development of wages and food prices. 
**Although it is not a direct linear relationship**, it can be said that GDP growth tends to be accompanied by increases in both wages and prices, which is in line with general macroeconomic expectations.
